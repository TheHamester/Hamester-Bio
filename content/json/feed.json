                "Well, today has been a long day, of debuggin my math, and propagate all new features to all supported by Hit Indication Minecraft versions!.. Took longer than I excepted, as always... But, hey, now you can configure color of indicators and you can enable edge of screen modifiers in place of normal mode, where they appear around your crosshair, because some people prefr those instead.",

                "Not much progress made on the wiki. I did pick a name for the universe, and decided to call it Libra Elemetum, which is Latin for something like \"Element of Balance\". I fixed a few typos today, improved navigation, and added the ability to view full resolution versions of images when you click on them in the content pages. Also I made a cute pixel art yesterday, representing more symbolically how <a href=\"#/wiki/locations/the-nucleus\">The Nucleus</a> is laid out, you can see it on the <a href=\"#/wiki/overseers\">Overseers</a> page.",
                "Other than that, didn't make much progress on developing the characters or locations, just tiny additions and tried to pick color pallettes for them, which you can see in the post image. Those are in no way final, I don't think. They certainly need tweaking, especially I need to come up with more features for <a href=\"#/wiki/overseers/hyra\">Hyra</a> and <a href=\"#/wiki/overseers/paraoh\">Paraoh</a>. I'm not sure I'm completely happy with the colors, and I still need to come up with distinct designs for the remaining overseers. Preferably something actually original and not just generic shark, griffon vulture, or whatever. <a href=\"#/wiki/overseers/zemothel\">Zemothel</a> currently feels like any other vulture character. Maybe outfits is what will make them unique and not body coloring. Stuff like that always was really difficult for me."

                "Today I've been porting my Hit Indication mod to a new Minecraft version 1.21... Usually takes like an hour max: Forge setup, it would do all the decomp for the first time (20 minutes), I would copy all the files from previous version, change a few method names here and there, and I would be good to go...",
                "Well... decomp did take 20 minutes... to then throw an OutOfMemory exception... after like an hour of trying giving it more RAM, and waiting, I figured I had to set Java version in IntelliJ to Java21, and then the exception didn't happen.",
                "Ok... now the copying thing, just a few changes with how some objects are created and how you get potion effects from the item stack, not that hard... except for when it came to the main thing - <b>RENDERING THE INDICATORS</b>. They completely removed any event related to Gui redering, and I only found out why when I looked through the forge commit history, because Mojang implemented a better system for layered GUI rendering... which, ofcourse, they didn't leave any API to access... Long story short, I ended up using mixins, for a mod that was going strong without them for a while.",
                "And then I find out that those APIs do exist in NeoForge, and Forge API feature request template even links to NeoForge Discord server, and to this day I was really confused about what's even the reason there are two different incompatable forks of forge, and it's some drama or something... Maybe I do need to move to NeoForge instead for newer versions of Minecraft idk.",
                "Anyway, rant over, been quite a ride today, Hit Indication for 1.21 is out, probably not a big deal, but it IS FOR ME!! Also might release a smaller mod at request of a friend that respawns you in a random location each time you die for 1.18.2, nothing big."
