    <p>
        Islands of The Moryx System are often utilized as places for reunion, leasure, mental reflection 
        and regeneration due to the central star radiating healing and calming energy, sources of which to this very day are unknown. 
        Moryx System is often informally referred to as "The Checkpoint of the Universe".
