        Island May is a one of the five islands orbiting the central star of the <a href="/#/wiki/locations/moryx-system">Moryx System</a>. 
            It's the 3rd closest island from <a href="/#/wiki/locations/moryx">Moryx</a>. The island always remains in the shade of its own moon, 
            which lets very limited starlight passing through to the surface. The surface is mostly covered by deep ocean. 
            There's a big lighthouse located at its only coast, which emits a bright red beam across the whole island.
