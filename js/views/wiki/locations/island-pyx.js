        Island Pyx is a one of the five islands orbiting the central star of the <a href="/#/wiki/locations/moryx-system">Moryx System</a>. 
            It's the 2nd closest island from <a href="/#/wiki/locations/moryx">Moryx</a>. It's a verdant island with a Pyxian Mountain Range 
            spanning on the edge of one half of the island wich partially surrounds the beautiful lush Mely Meadow which 
            coasts the Doreal Sea. On the other side of Doreal Sea there's a cherry blossom forest.
