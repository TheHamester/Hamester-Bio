    <h2>Liquia</h2>
    <p>
        Liquia is the mysterious energy that the star radiates out into the space. 
        It is observed to have healing and calming properties on the visitors of the orbiting islands. 
        It is believed to have obtained the ability to radiate liquia in the earlie days of the star's life. 
        A lot of studies have shown that the ability to radiate liquia could be related to the unusual molecular 
        structure of the star's core, but to this very day it has not been fully explained.
