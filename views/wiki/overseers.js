        Since the beginning of times, the balance of the universe was overseen by the Deity of Time named <a href="/#/wiki/overseers/xa">Xa</a>, 
        the Deity of Space named <a href="/#/wiki/overseers/oth">Oth</a>, and their 8 folowers put in control of each element and its direct opposite: 
        <b>Fire</b> as opposed to <b>Ice</b>, <b>Earth</b> as opposed to <b>Air</b>, <b>Water</b> as opposed to <b>Vapor</b>, and <b>Nature</b> as opposed to <b>Rot</b>. 
        Deity of Time's takes the physical form of an Axolotl, and Deity of Space's takes the physical form of a Snake.
        Each folower's physical form takes the shape of an anthropomorphic animal, opposites of each other share the same speices:

    <h2>Reincarnation</h2>
	<p>
		Overseers' physical forms are not immortal, yet their spirits are, and have a way of reincarnation in a new body through the process of natural birth. 
        Upon death their spirits are freed of their physical form, and roam the universe in search for a suitable host with the ability to give birth, often already 
        pregnant living beings, species of which should mostly resemble their physical form species, and preferably lacking advanced conciousness in order to avoid panic 
        and disruption among the anthropomorphic population.
    </p>
    <p>
        The spirit of an overseer does not replace the already present embryos, but merely appends themselves to the count. 
        If the host was to have 3 babies, they would give birth to 3 babies + to the overseer. The host does not feel any different and the sensations during 
        birth do not differ from natural process of birth among host's species. For mammals it would be live birth; for insects like, for example, moths they would go 
        through the whole process of: Egg -> Catterpillar -> Pupa -> Moth, which is probably the quickest and the least disruptive way of reincarnation.
	</p>
    <p>
		Upon being reborn the overseer resembles the baby version of their physical form. The growth rate of the physical body of the overseer is much more rapid 
        than the one of the average host's species representative. Upon reaching maturity the overseer in question comes back 
        to <a href="/#/wiki/locations/the-nucleus">The Nucleus</a>.
