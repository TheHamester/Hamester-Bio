        Xa [za] (They/Them) - Deity of Time. From their infinite gills flow scribes telling of everthing that has ever happened, is happenning, 
        will happen, and will never happen. They don't intervine in the natural flow of time, but are able to see all the possibilities, 
        and in the worst case they are able to restart the timeline.
    </p>
    <p>
        Xa resembles a three-eyed axolotl with white skin, cyan glowing eyes. The length of their gills is ambigous, 
        they span many lightyears, the transparency of the gills is periodic across their whole length and may be completely transparent for 
        long distances to then come into existance at random points in space or time, which is percieved by inhabitants of nearby planets as northern lights.
