        The Nucleus - the center of the universe. The Nucleus is where the universe began, 
        its gravitational force keeps the whole universe from falling apart. 
        It is the home to the overseers. <a href="/#/wiki/overseers/xa">Xa</a> resides in the very middle, 
        with 8 of their followers orbiting them as if they were electrons of an atom. 
        Followers of opposite elements orbit at opposite sides of each other. <a href="/#/wiki/overseers/oth">Oth</a> 
        resides at the outermost orbit of The Nucleus, revolving around <a href="/#/wiki/overseers/xa">Xa</a> and their followers, 
        in order to provide a protective shield for the overseers.
