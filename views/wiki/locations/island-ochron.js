        Island Ochron is a one of the five islands orbiting the central star of the <a href="/#/wiki/locations/moryx-system">Moryx System</a>. 
        It's the 4th outermost island from <a href="/#/wiki/locations/moryx">Moryx</a>. It is utilized as a universal library, archive and storage of all knowledge. 
        The library is located at the far most point of the island, to which there's a clear path through the Scrype Forest. 
    </p>

    <h2>Scrype Forest</h2>
    <p>
        It is a mildly dense forest of Scrype trees. Scrype trees are strong yet thin-trunced trees with light brown bark, 
        the leafs of which resemble curled bands of paper with faded glyphs written on both sides of them. In the middle of 
        trees there are several oases with small ponds of water which are able to absorb information about the events in close ptoximity of them.
    </p>

    <h2>The Universal Library</h2>
    <p>
        The Universal Library is a building surrounded by walls made of white marble ingraved with images of the overseers. 
        Behind those walls, a staircase leads inside the main hall of the library full of marble shelfs with books documenting every historical event, 
        every location and significant historical figure.
