                    This page contains most of the characters in my universe I've been trying to build sometime. 
                    Maybe if I get to expanding it even more, this website could turn into a sort of a host for the Wiki for it. 
                    Most of the art on this page was made by <a targe="_blank" href="https://www.deviantart.com/glitchbound1">Axovoxel</a>.
